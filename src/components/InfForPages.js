We want it back. We want the building back. That’s why I’m doing it. It took the fun out of the city."`, <br/>, "Travis initially confirmed the title in a May 2016 show, stating that it would follow BITTSM.

He once again collaborated with producer Quincy Jones as he did for Thriller and 1979’s Off the Wall, but this would be their last time working together. This final installment of the Jackson/Jones trilogy was another massive hit, selling millions of albums worldwide along with achieving more awards and accolades.', <br/>, 'Michael reportedly started demos for the album as early as November 1983 while he was working on the Victory album with his brothers The Jacksons. He would also create songs at his home studio and bring them into the Westlake Audio studio in Los Angeles to be re-produced and re-mixed by Quincy Jones and engineer Bruce Swedien. The recording process began in January 1985, around the time Michael co-wrote and Quincy produced the all-star charity single “We Are the World.” The recording sessions wrapped in July 1987, with “I Just Can’t Stop Loving You” being released as the first single the same month before the album’s August release.', <br/>, 'Like Thriller, Bad was a mix of R&B, Rock, Pop, and ballads that once again provided the formula to top the pop charts internationally. It has sold approximately 35 million records worldwide and is certified Diamond status with more than 11 million copies sold in the US, where the album sold over 2 million copies in its first week. Of the album’s 11 songs, nine were released as singles and the album was the first to produce five #1 pop singles on the Billboard Hot 100—"I Just Can’t Stop Loving You,“ "Bad,” “The Way You Make Me Feel,” “Man in the Mirror” and “Dirty Diana.” “Smooth Criminal” and “Another Part of Me” were Top 20 singles, while “Leave Me Alone” and “Liberian Girl” were also released as singles, which both topped the pop charts in Ireland. The film Moonwalker was released in 1988 and featured several music videos from Bad. This film led to a Moonwalker video game being released for the Sega Genesis console in 1990 and it was based around the visuals from “Smooth Criminal.”'],
